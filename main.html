            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I don't look like some beautiful bunnies, but I am a real king of rodents. I can get deepest in burrows.
            A mouse is a small rodent. Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded
            ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common
            house mouse. Mice are also popular as pets. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally
            common.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size. Generally, when a muroid rodent is discovered,
            its common name includes the term mouse if it is smaller, or rat if it is larger. The common terms rat
            and mouse are not taxonomically specific. Typical mice are classified in the genus Mus, but the term
            mouse is not confined to members of Mus and can also apply to species from other genera such as the deer
            mouse, Peromyscus.

        <h2>
            My Career
        </h2>
        <p>
            I work as a web developer for a company that make websites for mouse business. Most wild mice are timid
            toward humans and other animals, but they are very social with other mice. Domestic mice are very
            friendly toward humans and can make good pets for older children and adults. According to the RSPCA,
            mice are very territorial.
        </p>
        </p>

        <p>Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is
            attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild. The best-known strain of mouse is the
            white lab mouse. It has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research.
        </p>

        <p>Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to
            prey heavily upon mice. Despite this, mice populations remain plentiful. Due to its remarkable
            adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living
            on Earth today.
